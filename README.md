This project was created using data from nearly 170,000 football players in the Football Manager video game. Reports and visualizations were generated using various player attributes in the dataset. Pages were also created for filtering and searching player or club attributes. When a single player is selected, a player page is displayed showing various information about them; similarly, when a single club is selected, club information can be viewed. After downloading the project dataset, the data is preprocessed using Python, a database is created in PostgreSQL, and the data is loaded into tables in the database. Then, data from the database is transferred to Power BI and various reports, visualizations, etc. are created in Power BI.
